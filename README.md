# My Living City
In order to transform our cities into living cities that exist in complete integrity with the natural world, we need to empower every citizen to engage in a conversation for change and a call to take action in their community.

## Contribution
Development proposals can be posted for review and consultation by the community for feedback and suggestions, generating added value.	
## Co-creation
Citizens can suggest projects or improvements for discussion in the community that would lead to changes in the community.	
## Education
Through discussion forums and expert contributor blogs, the community can engage in a discussion of what sustainability is and how to achieve it.

## Our Vision
By creating an online space for collaboration and co-creation, we can initiate this conversation for change. In this online space citizens can offer ideas and visions to each other, allow them to be voted on, liked or shared with others. City planners can explore trending ideas to be selected for inclusion into their development plans and programs, as well as being informed on the priorities and visions of its residents to inform planning priorities.

The city can invite resident to review as well as provide feedback and contribution to development proposals. The ability to source the community and fully involve citizens into the planning process is made available.

Increasing the knowledge in the community, contributing experts can post on the sites blogs with information helping residents and cities to deepen their sustainable mindset and be more adept at making choices and decisions that reduce the impact to the environment. As well as creating an invitation for citizens to group and be the source of meaningful development in their community.
